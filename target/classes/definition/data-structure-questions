Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Data structure is necessary because is provides efficiency, abstraction, and reusability. It plays a
major role in enhancing the performance of a program because the main function of the program
is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
-Updation- updates or modifies the data
-Create
-Transversal- accessing particular data
-Destroy


List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A.I., numerical analysis, operating systems, database management, statistical analysis,
compiler design, and graphics.


What is an Array?
It is a container object that can hold a fixed number of values of the same  type.


what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is a fixed length data structure while and ArrayList is a variable-length data structure.


what is LinkedList?
An ordered collection that contains many objects of the same type.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
Array is a fixed length data structure of a similar type of data while LinkedList is an ordered collection of elements of the type where
each element is connected to the next using pointers.


what is queue?
It is a collection of items in which only the earliest added item may be accessed.


what is stack?
It is a last in, first out data structure.


what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO - First in, first out
LIFO - Last in, first out


what is the order of complexity?
It describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes depending on the amount of input data.
In ascending order of complexity: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)


what is the best case to search an element from an array?
the best case is O(1).


what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
the worst case is O(log N).


what is tree in data structure?
It is a hierarchical tree structure defined as a collection of nodes.


what is graph in data structure?
It is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.


what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS: Array
Network data model: Graph
Hierarchical data model: trees


How HashMap works in java?
HashMap in Java works on hashing principles. It is a data structure that allows us to store object and retrieve it in
constant time O(1) provided we know the key. In hashing, hash functions are used to link keys and values in HashMap.


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
It indicates that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. This error comes when you are accessing or
iterating over an array directly or indirectly.


What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
-Using variable assignment
-Create a new array of the same length and copy each element
-Use the clone method of the array
-Use System.arraycopy() method


What is difference between an array and a linked list?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked list is an ordered collection of elements of the
same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.


What is DFS and BFS?
BFS: breadth first search
DFS: depth first Search


What is Recursion?
It is a method that calls on itself


What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Linear: data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every element is attached to its
previous and next adjacent.
Non linear: data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.


What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O describes the set of all algorithms that run no worse than a certain speed


Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
-Selection sort: Ω(n^2)
-Bubble sort: Ω(n)
-Insertion sort: Ω(n)
-Heap sort: Ω(n log(n))
-Quick sort: Ω(n log(n))
-Merge sort: Ω(n log(n))
-Bucket sort: Ω(n+k)
-Radix sort: Ω(nk)
-Count sort: Ω(n+k)


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
