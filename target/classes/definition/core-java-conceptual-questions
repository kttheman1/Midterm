Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. Programing language is any set of rules that converts stings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual
programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output.



What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK is made up of JRE, JVM, Java, javac, javadoc, and jar.
JRE is Java Runtime Environment
JVM is the Java Virtual Machine
Java is an interpreter
javac is a compiler
javadoc is a document generator
jar is an archiver



What is IDE?
A. Integrated Development Environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer
   programmers for software development. It consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a
   debugger.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, MyEclipse, NetBeans, BlueJ, DrJava, jCreator, and Greenfoot.



Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. The java life cycle is made up of three parts; editing the program, compiling the source code,
and executing the byte code.

What is class?
A. A class is a template used to create objects and to define object
data types and methods.


What is object?
A. It is an instance of a Java class


What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main() method is the entry point of a Java application


Why main is static?
A. Java main() method is always static because then the compiler class can call it without
the creation of an object of the class.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. the Object class


What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. path is set for java tools in java programs like java and javac which are used
to compile code while classpath is used by system or application class loader to
locate and load compiled java bytecodes stored in the class file.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. An interface only allows you to define functionality not implement it while an
abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class? If not how do you use it?
A. No you can't, but it is possible to implement a subclassof abstract class


What is an Access Specifier?
A. It defines how the members of a class can be accessed.


What is OOP? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming. Some features include encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism,
and inheritance.
Encapsulation: wrapping the data and the code acting on the data into a single unit.
Abstraction: reducing the object to its essence so only  the necessary characteristics
are shown to the users.
Polymorphism: an object's ability to take on many forms.
Inheritance: when one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent
object.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A Java package is used to group related classes. Java compiler imports java. lang package internally by default.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API is Application programming interface. APIs that I have used so far are,
Amazon, Facebook, Google Maps, and Yahoo Finance.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but
can extend only one class. Multiple inheritance is not supported because it leads to deadly diamond problem.


What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading occurs when 2 or more methods in a class have the same method name
but different parameters.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception disruptions the normal flow of the program's instructions. The try-catch is the simplest method
of handling exceptions.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Static keyword is used for memory management, it is used to share the same variables or method of a given class.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Final keyword means that the value can't be changed in the future. It is used in a method declaration to indicate that the method
cannot be overridden by subclasses.


What is final, finally and finalize?
Final is a keyword. The variable declared as final should be
initialized only once and cannot be changed.
Finally is a block. The finally block always executes when the try block exits. This ensures that the finally block is executed
even if an unexpected exception occurs.
Finalize is a method. Before an object is garbage collected, the runtime system calls its finalize() method. You can write system
resources release code in finalize() method before getting garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is similar to a method that is invoked when an object of the class is created.


Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A class can have multiple constructors that assign the fields in different ways.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
The default constructor.


What is "this" keyword in java ?
It's a keyword that refers to the current object in a method or constructor.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
-super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable
-super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method
-super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor


What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine


Is JVM platform independent?
JVM is platform dependent


What version of java are you using?
java version "1.8.0_311"


What is JAR stand for ?
Java Archive


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is a software development kit whereas JVM is an environment for
executing bytecode.


What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JVM is an environment for executing bytecode whereas JRE is a software bundle
that allows Java program to run.


What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code.
Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.


What is heap?
It is memory used by programming languages to store global variables.


How java manage it's memory?
java uses a memory management system called garbage collector.


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable compared to the other two. StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized unlike
StringBuilder.


What is Singleton class?
It's a class that can only have one object at a time.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual java
object in memory.


When to use transient variable in java?
It is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
The while loop in java executes one or more statements after testing the loop continuation condition
at the start of each iteration. The do-while loop, however, tests the loop continuation condition after
the first iteration has completed.


What is Enum?
An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.


What is Iterator?
It is an object that can be used to loop through collections.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer takes more memory at 128 bits.


Why is String Immutable in Java?
Because String objects are cached in the String pool.


What is constructor chaining in Java?
The process of invoking a sequence of constructor upon initialization of a class object.


The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A serial garbage collector uses a single thread for garbage collection process while the parallel
garbage collector uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.


What is JIT stands for?
Just-In-Time


Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java heap space: the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM
Garbage collection: It automatically determines what memory is no longer being used by a Java application
and recycles this memory for other uses.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Heap is used throughout the application but stack is only used for the methods currently running.


What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is a feature that allows an executing java program to examine or introspect upon itself and
it manipulates internal properties of the program.


What is multithreading in java?
Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization
of the CPU.



What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.


What is Framework?
It's a platform for developing software apps and java programs.


What are the testing Frameworks available in java?
JUnit, JBehave, Serenity, Selenium, TestNG, Mockito, HTTPUnit, Gauge, and Geb.


Difference between jUnit and testNG?
JUnit is an open-source framework used to trigger and write tests. TestNG is a Java-based
framework that is an upgraded option for running tests. JUnit does not support to run parallel tests.


What are the dependencies for this project?
mongo java driver, my sql connector and testing


What is dependency injection in java?
Dependency injection is the concept in which objects get other required objects from outside.


What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding: the execution of a program where type of object is determined at compile
time, this is when the compiler executes the code it know the type of object or class to which object belongs.
Dynamic binding: When the compiler resolves the method call binding during the execution of the program.
Binding takes place during the actual execution of the program.
